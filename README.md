## Exchange Rate Fetch

https://marksparkyryan.github.io/ExchangeRateFetch/

This was a project in Brad Traversy's JS course. Users can select two currencies to see the latest exchange rate. 

I have added a few more features to this project beyond the original scope that I thought were needed: 
    - Added a fun graph to display rates going back 9 months (ChartJS)
    - Write data to local storage to minimize API calls 

## Project Specifications

- Display UI with 2 select lists for countries and 2 inputs for amounts
- Fetch exchange rates from API (https://api.exchangerate-api.com)
- Display the values for both countries
- Update values on amount change
- Swap country rates
